<p>In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert demonstrated in thier book ‘Perceptrons’, that a single layer of artificial neurons cannot learn simple, critical mathematical functions like XOR logic gate. While they subsepently demonstrated in the same book that additional layers can solve this problem, only the first insight was recognized, leading to the start of the first AI winter.</p>

<p>GPU stand for Graphics Processing Unit (also known as a graphic card). Standard computers have various components like CPUs, RAM, etc. CPUs, or central processing units, are the core units of all standard computers, and they execute the instructions that make up the computer programs. GPUs, on the other hand, are spezialized units meant for displaying graphics, especially the 3D graphics in mordern computer games. The hardware optimitations used in GPUs allwo it to handle thousand of tasks at the same time. Incidentally, these optimization allow us to run and train neural networks hundreds of times fast than a regualr CPU.</p>

<p>For us humans, it is easy to identify images in a photos, such as identifying cats vs dogs in a photo. This is because, subconsiously our brains have learned which features define a cat or a dog for example. But it is hard to define set tules for a traditional computer program to revognize a cat or a dog. Can you think of a universal rule to determmine if a photo contains a cat or dog? How would you encode that as a computer program? This is very difficult becouse cats. dogs. or other objects, have a wide variety of shapes, textures, colors, and other futures, and it is close to impssible to manually encode thin in a traditional computer program.</p>

<p>“weight assignment” refers to the current values of the model parameters. Arthur Samuel further mentions an “automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assigment” and a “mechanism for altering the weight assigment so as to maximize the performance”. This refers to the evalutaion and training of the model in order to obtain a set of parameter values that maximzes model performance.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-is-it-hard-to-understand-why-a-deep-learning-model-makes-a-particular-prediction">14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?</h3>
<p>This is a highly-resarched topic known as interprretability of deep learning models. Deep learning models are hard to understand in part due to thier “deep” nature. Think of a linar regression model. Simply we have some input variables/date that are multiplied by some weights, giving us an output. We can understand which variables are more important and which are less importand based on thier weights. A similar logic might apply for a small neural network with 1-3 layers. However, deep neural networks have hundreds, if not thaousands, of layers. It is hard to dertmine which factors are important in determining the final output. The neurons in the network interact with each other with the outouts of some neurons feeding into other neurons. Altogether, due to the compley nature of deep learning models, it is very difficult to understand why a neural network makes a given prediction.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, recent research has made it easier to better understand a neural network´s prediction. For example, as shown in this chapter, we can anylyse the sets of weights and determine what kind of featues activate the neurons. When applying CNNS to images, we can also see which parts of the images highly activate the model. We will see how we can make our models interpretable later in the book.</p>

<p>The ‘universal approximation theorem’ states that neural networks can theoretically represent any mathematical funtion. However, it ist important to realize that practically, due to the limits of available data and computer hardware, it is impossible to practically train a model to du so. But we get very close!</p>

<p>You will need an architecture for the given problem. You will need data to input to your model. For most use-cases of deep learning, you need labels for your data to compare your model predictions to. You will need a loss funtion that will quantitavely measure the performance of your model. And you need a way to update the paramters of the model in order to timprove its performance. (this is kńown as an optimizer).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-could-a-feedback-loop-impact-the-rollout-of-a-predictive-policing-model">17. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?</h3>
<p>In a predictive policing model, we might end up with a positive feeback loop, leading to highly biased model with little predictive power. For example, we may want a model that would predict crimes, but we use information on arrestst as a proxy. However, this data itself is slightly biased due to the biases in existing policing processes. Training with this data leads to a biased model. Law enforcement might use the model to dertmine where to focus police activity, increasing arrests in those areas. These additional arrests would be used in training future iterations of models, leading to an even more biased model. This cycle continues as a positive feedback loop.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-validation-set-what-is-a-test-set-why-do-we-need-them">20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?</h3>
<p>The validation set is the portion of the data set that is used to for training the model, but for evaluating the model during training, in order to prevent overfitting. This ensures that the model performance is not due to “cheating” or memorization of the dataset, but rather because it learns the appropriate features to use for the prediction.</p>
<p>However, it is possible that we overfit the validation data as well. This is because the human modeler is also part of the training process, adjusting hyperparameters (see question 32 for definition) and training procedures according to the validation performance. Therefore, another unseen portion of the dataset, the test set, is used for final evaluation of the model. This splitting of the data set is necessary to ensure that the model generalizes to unseend data.</p>

<p>A good validation or test set should be representative of new data you will see in the future. Sometimes this isn’t ture if a random sample is used. For example, for time series data, selecting sets randomly does not make sense. Instead, defining different time periods for the train, validation, and test set is a better approach.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-overfitting-provide-an-example.">23. What is overfitting? Provide an example.</h3>
<p>Overfitting is the most challenging issue when it comes to training machine learning models. Overfitting refers to when the model fits too closely to a limited set of data but does not generalize well on unseen data. This is especially important when it comes to neural networks. because neural networks can protentially “memorize” the dataset that the model was trained on, and will perform abysmally on unseen data because id didn’t “memorize” the ground truth values for that data. This is why a proper validation framework is needed by splitting the data into trainin, validation, and test sets.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-metic-how-does-it-differ-from-loss">24. What is a metic? How does it differ from loss?</h3>
<p>A metric is a function that measures quality of the model’s predictions using the validation set. This is similar to the loss, which is also a measure of performance of the model. However, loss is meant for the optimization algorithm (like SGD) to effciently update the model prameters, while metrics are human-interpretabeble measures of performance. Sometimes, a metric may also be a good choice for the loss.</p>

<p>Pretrained models habe been trained on other pronlems that my be quite similar to the current task. For expamle, pretrained image recognition models were often trained on the ImageNet dataset, which has 1000 classes focuesd on al lot of different types of visual objects. Pretrained models are useful becaouse they have already learned how to handle a lot of imple features like edge and color detection. However, since the model was trained for a diffferent task than already used, this model cannot be used as is.</p>

<p>When using pretrained moedel, the later layers of the model, which were useful for the task that the model was originally trained on, are replaced with one or more new layers with randomized wights, of an appropriate size for the dataset you are working with. These new layers are called the “head” of the model.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="are-image-models-useful-only-for-photos">28. Are image models useful only for photos?</h3>
<p>Nope! Image models can be useful for other types of images like sketches, medical data, etc.</p>
<p>However, a lot of information can be represented as images. For example, a sound can be converted into a spectrogram, which is a visual interpretation of the audio. Time series (ex: financialy data) can be converted to image by plotting on a graph. Even better, there are various transformations that generate images from time series, and have achieved good results for time series calssification. There are many other exapmles, and by being creative, it may be possible to fomulate your problem as an image calssification problem, and use pretrained images models to obation state-of-the-art results!</p>
