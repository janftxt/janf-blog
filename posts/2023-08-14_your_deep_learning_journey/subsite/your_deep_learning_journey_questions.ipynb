    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1969, Marvin Minsky an Seymour Papert demonstrated in their book, \"Perceptrons\", that a single layer of artificial neurons cannot learn simple, critical mathematical functions like XOR logic gate. While they subsequently demonstrated in the same book that additional layers can solve this problem, only the first insight was recognizes, leading to the start of the first AI winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1980's models with tow layers were being explored. Theoretically, it is possible to approximate any mathematical function using two layers of artificial neurons. However, in practices, these networks were too big and too slow. While it was demonstrated that adding additional layers improved performance, this insight was not acknowledged, and the second AI winter began. In this past decade, with increased data availability, and improvements in computer hardware (both in CPU performance but more importantly in GPU performance), neural networks are finally living up to its potential.\n",

These optimizations and capability's allow us to run and train neural networks hundreds of times faster than a regular CPU.\n",

    "When creating a normal computer program think about some steps and translate them into code. As Example we can write an algorithm to sort a list. But for recognizing an image or object it is tricky. We as human subconsciously learned a lot of features defining one object from an other. It is very difficult to manually code these complex patterns of shapes, textures, colors, and other features to recognize different objects and images.\n",

    "“weight assignment” refers to the current values of the model parameters. Arthur Samuel further mentions an “ automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment ” and a “ mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance ”. This refers to the evaluation and training of the model in order to obtain a set of parameter values that maximizes model performance.\n",

    "Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "All kinds of machine learning models (including deep learning and traditional statical models) can be challenging to fully understand. Think of a linear regression model. Simply, we have some input variables/data that are multiplied by some weights, giving us an output. We can understand which variables are more important and which are less important based on their weights. A similar logic might apply for a small neural network with 1-3 layers. However, deep neural networks have hundreds, if not thousands, of layers. It is hard to determine which factors are important in determining the final output. The neurons in the network interact with each other, with the outputs of some neurons feeding into other neurons. Altogether, due to the complex nature of deep learning models, it is very difficult to understand why a neural network makes a given prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases, recent research has made it easier to better understand a neural network’s prediction. For example, as shown in this chapter, we can analyze the sets of weights and determine what kind of features activate the neurons. When applying CNNs to images, we can also see which parts of the images highly activate the model. We will see how we can make our models interpretable later in the book.\n",
