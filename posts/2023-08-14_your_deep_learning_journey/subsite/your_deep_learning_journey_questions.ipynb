While they subsequently demonstrated in the same book that additional layers can solve this problem, only the first insight was recognizes, leading to the start of the first AI winter.\n",

    "In the 1980's models with tow layers were being explored. Theoretically, it is possible to approximate any mathematical function using two layers of artificial neurons. However, in practices, these networks were too big and too slow. While it was demonstrated that adding additional layers improved performance, this insight was not acknowledged, and the second AI winter began. In this past decade, with increased data availability, and improvements in computer hardware (both in CPU performance but more importantly in GPU performance), neural networks are finally living up to its potential.\n",

    "“weight assignment” refers to the current values of the model parameters. Arthur Samuel further mentions an “ automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment ” and a “ mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance ”. This refers to the evaluation and training of the model in order to obtain a set of parameter values that maximizes model performance.\n",

    "Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "All kinds of machine learning models (including deep learning and traditional statical models) can be challenging to fully understand. Think of a linear regression model. Simply, we have some input variables/data that are multiplied by some weights, giving us an output. We can understand which variables are more important and which are less important based on their weights. A similar logic might apply for a small neural network with 1-3 layers. However, deep neural networks have hundreds, if not thousands, of layers. It is hard to determine which factors are important in determining the final output. The neurons in the network interact with each other, with the outputs of some neurons feeding into other neurons. Altogether, due to the complex nature of deep learning models, it is very difficult to understand why a neural network makes a given prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases, recent research has made it easier to better understand a neural network’s prediction. For example, as shown in this chapter, we can analyze the sets of weights and determine what kind of features activate the neurons. When applying CNNs to images, we can also see which parts of the images highly activate the model. We will see how we can make our models interpretable later in the book.\n",

    "You need a architecture, a general template for how that kind of model works internally. For training/fitting the model you need data to specialize the general architecture. To define how well a model does on a single prediction. We need to define a loss function, which determines how good the model performs. Do determine the loss we need labeled data, data indicating what it represent.\n",

    "How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a predictive policing model, we might end up with a positive feedback loop, leading to a highly biased model with little predictive power. For example, we may want a model that would predict crimes, but we use information on arrests as a proxy . However, this data itself is slightly biased due to the biases in existing policing processes. Training with this data leads to a biased model. Law enforcement might use the model to determine where to focus police activity, increasing arrests in those areas. These additional arrests would be used in training future iterations of models, leading to an even more biased model. This cycle continues as a positive feedback loop.\n",

    "- <b>Test set</b> As we hold the validation data back from the training process, we can hold back a test set data even from ourselves. It cannot be used to improve the model, it can only be used to evaluate the model at the very end. (Take out some data for testing and split the rest to 80% for training and 20% for validation)\n",

    "A good validation or test set should be representative of new data you will see in the future. Sometimes this isn't true if a random sample is used. For example, for times series data, selecting sets randomly does not make sense. Instead, defining different time periods for the train, validation, and test set is a better approach.\n",

    "What is a metic? How does it differ from loss?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a metric may remind you of loss, but there is an important distinction. The entire purpose of loss is to define a \"measure of performance\" that the training system can use to update weights automatically. In other words, a good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand, and that hews as closely as possible to what you want the model to do. At times, you might decide that the loss function is a suitable metric, but that is not necessarily the case.\n",

    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A model that has weights that have already been trained on some other dataset is called a pretrained model. You should nearly always use a pretrained model, because it means that your model, before you've even shown it any of your data, is already very capable. For instance, parts of pretrained models will handle edge, gradient, and color detection, which are needed for many tasks. Using pretrained models is the most important method we have to allow us to train more accurate models, more quickly, with less data, and less time and money.\n",

Time series (ex: financial data) can be converted to image by plotting on a graph. Even better, there are various transformations that generate images from time series, and have achieved good results for time series classification. There are many other examples, and by being creative, it may be possible to formulate your problem as an image classification problem, and use pretrained image models to obtain state-of-the-art results!\n",
