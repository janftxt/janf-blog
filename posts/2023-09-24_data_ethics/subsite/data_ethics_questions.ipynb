    "Does ethics provide a list of \"right answers\"?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no list of do's and dont's. Ethics is complicated, and context-dependent. It involves the perspectives of many stakeholders. Ethics is a muscle that you have to develop and practice.\n",

    "<b>\n",
    "How can working with people of different background help when considering ethical questions?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When everybody on a team has similar backgrounds, they are likely to have similar blind spots around ethical risks. Diversity can lad to problems being identified earlier, and a wider range of solutions being considers.\n",

    "What was the role of IBM Nazi Germany? Why did the company participate as they did? Why did the workers participate?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM supplied the Nazis with data tabulation products necessary to track the extermination of Jews and other groups on a massive scale. This was driven from the top of the company, with marketing to Hitler and his leadership team. Company President Thomas Watson personally approved the 1939 release of special IBM alphabetizing machines to help organize the deportation of Polish Jews. Hitler awarded Watson a special “Service to the Reich” medal in 1937.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it also happened throughout the organization. IBM and its subsidiaries provided regular training and maintenance on-site at the concentration camps: printing off cards, configuring machines, and repairing them as they broke frequently. IBM set up categorizations on their punch card system for the way that each person was killed, which group they were assigned to, and the logistical information necessary to track them through the vast Holocaust system. IBM’s code for Jews in the concentration camps was 8, where around 6,000,000 were killed. Its code for Romanis was 12 (they were labeled by the Nazis as “asocials”, with over 300,000 killed in the Zigeunerlager , or “Gypsy camp”). General executions were coded as 4, death in the gas chambers as 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketers were just doing what they could to meet their business development goals. Edwin Black, author of “IBM and the Holocaust”, said: “To the blind technocrat, the means were more important than the ends. The destruction of the Jewish people became even less important because the invigorating nature of IBM’s technical achievement was only heightened by the fantastical profits to be made at a time when bread lines stretched across the world.”\n",

    "What was the role of the first person jailed in the VW diesel scandal?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first person who was jailed as a result of the Volkswagen scandal, in which the car company was revealed to have cheated on its diesel emissions test, was not the manager who oversaw the project, or an executive at the holm of the company. It was one of the engineers, James Liang, who just did what he was told.\n",

    "What was the problem with a database of suspected gang members maintained by California law enforcement officials?\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A database of suspected gang members maintained by california law enforcement officials was found to be full of errors, including 42 babies who had been added to the database when they were less than 1 year old (28 of whom were marked as admitting to being gang members). In this case, there was no process in place for correcting mistakes or removing people once they’d been added. \n",

    "Why did Youtube's recommendation algorithm recommend videos of partially clothed children to pedophiles, even although no employee at Google programmed this feature?\n",

    "YouTube recommendation algorithm had begun curating playlists for pedophiles, picking out innocent home videos that happened to contain prepubescent, partially clothed children.\n",

    "Part of the problem here is the centrality of metrics in driving a financially important system. When an algorithm has a metric to optimize, it will do everything it can to optimize that number. This tends to lead to all kinds of edge cases, and human interacting with a system will search for, find, and exploit these edge cases and feedback loops for their advantage.\n",

    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A engineer ar Meetup, discussed the example of men expressing more interest than women in tech meetups. Taking gender into account could therefore cause Meetups algorithm to suggest even fewer tech meetups to women. \n",
    "\n",
    "The team at meetup made the ethical decision for their recommendation algorithm to not create such a feedback loop, by explicitly not using gender for that part of their model.\n",
