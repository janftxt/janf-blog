    "text": "Back to blog post\n\n\n\nfastai book chapter 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nSource: Fastbook Chapter 2 questionnaire solutions (wiki)\n\n\n\n Where do text models currently have major deficiency? \nCurrently deep learning is not good at generating correct responses! We don’t have a reliable way to, for instance, combine a knowledge base of medical information with a deep learning model for generating medically correct natural language responses. This can be very dangerous, as the layman may not be able to evaluate the factual accuracy of the generated text.\n What are possible negative societal implications of text generation models? \nA negative societal concern is that context-appropriate, highly compelling responses on social media could be used at massive scale, to spread disinformation, create unrest and encourage conflict.\nModels reinforce bias (like gender bias, racial bias) in training data and create a vicious cycle of biased outputs.\n In situations where a model might make mistakes, and those mistakes could be harmful, what is a good alternative to automating a process? \nOne alternative is to use an entirely manual process, with your deep learning model approach running in parallel but not being used directly to drive any actions. The humans involved in the manual process should look at the deep learning output and check whether they make sense.\n What kind of tabular data is deep learning particularly good at? \nIt great for analyzing time series and tabular data. Deep learning is also great at increasing columns containing neutral language and high categorical columns.\n What’s a key downside of directly using a deep learning model for recommendation systems? \nAlmost all machine learning approaches have the downside that they tell you only which product a particular user might like, rather than what recommendations would be helpful for a user. For example, if a user is familiar with other books from the same author, it isn’t helpful to recommend those products even though the user bought the author’s book. Or, recommending products a user may have already purchased.\n What are the steps of the Drivetrain Approach? \n\nDefine an objective\nUnderstand the levers: what inputs can you control?\nWhat data can you collect?\nmodel the levers in order to understand how they affect the objective.\n\nThe basic idea is to start with considering your objective, than think about what actions you can tak to meet that objective, then think about what actions you can take to meet that objective and what data you have (or can acquire) than can help, and then build a model that you can use to determine tha best actions to take to get the best results in terms of your objective.\n Create an image recognition model using data you curate, and deploy, it on the web. \nTodo. Watch Lesson 2 for help.\n What is Dataloaders? \n\nA DataLoader doesn’t care about preparing data, it expects the data ready to go and only cares about how to load the data (e.g. whether in parallel or in a single process) as well as feeding the data to the model in batches (i.e. batch size)\nA DataLoaders is a thin wrapper for more than one DataLoader\n\n What four things do we need to tell fastai to create DataLoaders? \n\nwhat kinds of data we working with\nhow to get the list of items\nhow to label these items\nhow to create the validation set\n\n What does the splitter parameter to DataBlock do? \nThe splitter parameter provides argument to tell fastai DataBlock to splits the data in a training and validation data set. For example create a 80% training und 20% validation random split of the data you could use splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed = 42). With the random seed 42 we fix the randomness to get the same result for every run.\n How do we ensure a random split always gives the same validation set? \nComputer normally don’t generate truly random outputs they use a pseudo-random-generator which takes a random seed as an input. With random seed input we will get the same result for every run. Using a random seed, we can generate a random split that gives the same training and validation set.\n What letters are often used to signify the independent and dependent variables? \n\nx is independent\n\nAn independent variable is the variable you manipulate or vary in an experimental study to explore its effects. It’s called “independent” because it’s not influenced by any other variables in the study\n\ny is dependent\n\nA dependent variable is the variable that changes as a result of the independent variable manipulation. It’s the outcome you’re interested in measuring, and it “depends” on your independent variable.\n\n\n What the difference between crop, pad, and squish Resize() approaches? When might you choose one over the other? \nThe default of the fastai resize function is crop.\n\nCrop (Zuschneiden) –&gt; Fits the images to fit a square of the size requested, using the full width or height. This can result in losing some important details. For example lossing some key features that are cut out of the image.\nPad (Auffuellen) –&gt; Pad adds black pixels to reach the requested size. If we pad an image we have a lot of empty space, which is wasted computation for our model, and lowers the effective resolution of the images.\nSquish (Stauchen) –&gt; Squish stretches or squishes the image to the requested size. This can cause the image to take an unnatural form, leading to a model that learns that things look different.\n\nThe right resize function depends on the underlying images. If the features of the images are all over the place in the image crop can cut out important features. This can result in loss in information and squishing of padding may be more useful.\nAnother better method could be RandomResizedCrop, in which we crop a randomly selected region of the image. So every epoch, the model will see a different part of the image and will learn accordingly.\n What is data augmentation? Why is it needed? \nData augmentation refers to creating random variations of our input data, such that they appear different but do not change the meaning of the data. Examples of common data augmentation techniques for images are rotation, flipping, perspective warping, brightness changes, and contrast changes. Data augmentation is useful for the model to better understand the basic concept of what an object is and how the objects of interest are represented in images. Therefore, data augmentation allows machine learning models to generalize better. This is especially important when it can be slow and expensive to label data.\n Provide an example of where the bear classification model might work poorly in production, due to structural or style differences in the training data. \n\nThere is no bear in the image and the model has output option for not_a_bear.\nNighttime images are passed into the model.\nThe images vary in resolution. Low-resolution image.\nThe bear is really far or near the camera.\nThe model is very biased towards one type of features (eg. color.)\n\n What is the difference between item_tfms and batch_tfms? \n\nitem_tfms are transformations applied to a single data sample x on the CPU. Resize() is a common transform because the mini-batch of input images to a cnn must have the same dimensions. Assuming the images are RGB with 3 channels, then Resize() as item_tfms will make sure the images have the same with and height.\nbatch_tfms are applied to batched data samples (aka individual samples that have been collated into a mini-batch) on the GPU. They are faster and more efficient than item_tfms. A good example of these are the ones provided by aug_transform(). Inside are several batch-level augmentation that help many models.\n\n What is a confusion matrix? \nIn the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as error matrix, is specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one; in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix.\nEach row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class, of vise versa. The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see whether the system is confusing two classes.\n What does export save do? \nA model consists of two parts. The architecture and the trained parameters, the best way is to save both of these. In fastai you use the export method. This method even saves the definition of how to create your DataLoaders. This is important because otherwise you would have to redefine how to transform your data in order to use your model in production.\n What is it called when we use a model for getting predictions, instead of training? \nWhen we use a model for getting predictions, instead of training, we call it inference.\n What are IPyhton widgets? \nIPython widgets are GUI components that bring together Javascript und Python functionality in a web browser and can be created and used within a Jupyter notebook. One example of these interactive GUI components would be an upload button which can be created with the Python function widgets.FileUpload().\n When might you want to use CPU for deployment? When might GPU be better? \nGPUs are best for doing identical work in parallel. If you will analyzing single pieces of data at time (like a single image or single sentence), then CPUs may be more effective instead, especially with more market competition for CPU servers versus GPU servers. GPUs could be used if you collect user responses into a batch at a time, and perform inference on the batch. This my require the user to wait for model predictions. Additionally, there are many other complexities when it comes to GPU inference, like memory management and queuing of the batches.\n What are the downsides of deploying your app to a server, instead of to a client (or edge) device such as a phone or PC? \nOne downside for using a server over a client that you will require a network connection and there will be some latency each time the model is called. Another negative point can be that some users may be concerned uploading sensitive data to your remote server. Managing the complexity and scaling the server can create additional overhead too, whereas if your model runs on the edge devices, each user is\n What are 3 examples of problems that could occur when rolling out a bear warning system in practice? \nThe model we trained will likely perform poorly when:\n\nHandling night-time images\nDealing with low-resolution images (ex: some smartphone images)\nThe model returns prediction too slowly to be useful\n\n What is “out of domain data”? \nOut of domain data is data that is significantly different in structure or style th those used to train the model. For instance, if there were no black-and-white images in the training data, the model may do poorly on black-and-white images.\n What is “domain shift”? \nThis is when the type of data changes gradually over time. For example, an insurance company is using a deep learning model as part of their pricing algorithm, but over time their customers will be different, with the original training data not being representative of current data, and the deep learning model being applied on effectively out-of-domain data.\n What are the 3 steps in the deployment process? \n\nManual process\n\nRun model in parallel\nHuman check all predictions\n\nLimited scope deployment\n\nCareful human supervision\nTime or geography limited\n\nGradual expansion\n\nGood reporting systems needed\nConsider what could go wrong"

The layers are trained by alogrithms that minimze thier accuracy. In this way, the network learn to perform a specified task.\n Do you need these for Deep Learning?\n\nLots of Math (True/False)\nLots of Data (True/False)\nLots of expensive computers (True/False)\nA Phd (True/False) \nLots of Math (False)\nLots of Data (False)\nLots of expensive computers (False)\nA Phd (False)\n\n Name five areas where deep learning is now the best tool in the world? \n\nMedicine\n\nCancer detection\n\nSecurity\n\nSpam detection\n\nComputer vision\n\nClassification of Images\n\nPlaying Games\n\nChess, Go\n\nNatural language processing (NLP)\n\nsummerizing documents, classifying documents\n\n\n What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron? \nMark 1-Perceptron.\nFrank Rosenblatt further developed the artificial neuron to give it the ability to learn. Based on this he worked on building the first device that actually used these principles, the Mark ! Perceptron.\n Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distrubted processing? \nBased on the definition parallel distributed processing the requirements are: 1. A set of processing units 2. A stat of activation 3. An output function for each unit 4. A pattern of connectivity among units 5. A propagation rule for propagating pattern of activities through th network of conductivities. 6. An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit. 7. A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience. 8. An environment within which the system must operate.\n What were the tow theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks? \nIn 1969, Marvin Minsky an Seymour Papert demonstrated in their book, “Perceptrons”, that a single layer of artificial neurons cannot learn simple, critical mathematical functions like XOR logic gate. While they subsequently demonstrated in the same book that additional layers can solve this problem, only the first insight was recognizes, leading to the start of the first AI winter.\nIn the 1980’s models with tow layers were being explored. Theoretically, it is possible to approximate any mathematical function using two layers of artificial neurons. However, in practices, these networks were too big and too slow. While it was demonstrated that adding additional layers improved performance, this insight was not acknowledged, and the second AI winter began. In this past decade, with increased data availability, and improvements in computer hardware (both in CPU performance but more importantly in GPU performance), neural networks are finally living up to its potential.\n What is a GPU? \nA GPU is a Graphics Processing Unit. They were specializes processing units designed to accelerate graphics redndering for gaming. Thanks to their unique capability to efficiently parallelize massive distributed computational processes, GPUs have successfully been applied to applications beyond their original remit. These optimizations and capability’s allow us to run and train neural networks hundreds of times faster than a regular CPU.\n Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens? \nIn Jupyter Notebook we can create code cells in an interactive manner. When we execute a cell containing some code, the code runs by Python and the output is displayed under the curren code cell.\nCode Cell: 1+1 Output under der Code Cell: 2\n Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen. \nToDo\n Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix (https://oreil.ly9uPZe). \nToDo\n Why is it hard to use traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo? \nWhen creating a normal computer program think about some steps and translate them into code. As Example we can write an algorithm to sort a list. But for recognizing an image or object it is tricky. We as human subconsciously learned a lot of features defining one object from an other. It is very difficult to manually code these complex patterns of shapes, textures, colors, and other features to recognize different objects and images.\n What did Samuel mean by “weight assignment”? \n“weight assignment” refers to the current values of the model parameters. Arthur Samuel further mentions an “ automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment ” and a “ mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance ”. This refers to the evaluation and training of the model in order to obtain a set of parameter values that maximizes model performance.\n What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called “weights”? \nWeights are also called parameters.\n Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel`s view of a machine learning model. \n\n\n\nmachine learning model\n\n\n Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction? \nAll kinds of machine learning models (including deep learning and traditional statical models) can be challenging to fully understand. Think of a linear regression model. Simply, we have some input variables/data that are multiplied by some weights, giving us an output. We can understand which variables are more important and which are less important based on their weights. A similar logic might apply for a small neural network with 1-3 layers. However, deep neural networks have hundreds, if not thousands, of layers. It is hard to determine which factors are important in determining the final output. The neurons in the network interact with each other, with the outputs of some neurons feeding into other neurons. Altogether, due to the complex nature of deep learning models, it is very difficult to understand why a neural network makes a given prediction.\nHowever, in some cases, recent research has made it easier to better understand a neural network’s prediction. For example, as shown in this chapter, we can analyze the sets of weights and determine what kind of features activate the neurons. When applying CNNs to images, we can also see which parts of the images highly activate the model. We will see how we can make our models interpretable later in the book.\n What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy? \nIf you regard a neural network as a mathematical function, it turns out to be a function which is extremely flexible depending on its weights. A mathematical proof called the universal approximation theorem shows that this function can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory.\n What do you need in order to train a model? \nYou need a architecture, a general template for how that kind of model works internally. For training/fitting the model you need data to specialize the general architecture. To define how well a model does on a single prediction. We need to define a loss function, which determines how good the model performs. Do determine the loss we need labeled data, data indicating what it represent.\n How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model? \nIn a predictive policing model, we might end up with a positive feedback loop, leading to a highly biased model with little predictive power. For example, we may want a model that would predict crimes, but we use information on arrests as a proxy . However, this data itself is slightly biased due to the biases in existing policing processes. Training with this data leads to a biased model. Law enforcement might use the model to determine where to focus police activity, increasing arrests in those areas. These additional arrests would be used in training future iterations of models, leading to an even more biased model. This cycle continues as a positive feedback loop.\n Do we always have to use 224x224-pixel images with the cat recogintion? \nNo, This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything. If you increase the size, you’ll often get a model with better results (since it will be able to focus on more details), but at the price of speed and memory consumption; the opposite is true if you decrease the size.\n What is the difference between classification and regression? \n\nClassification A classification model is one that attempts to predict a class, or category. That is, it’s predicting from a number of discrete possibilities.\nRegression A regression model is one that attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities, such as a temperature or a location.\n\n What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them? \n\nTraining set The data used for fitting the model, does not include any data from the validation set. (If there is enough data 80% is used for training)\nValidation set A set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is. (If there is enough data 20% is used for validation)\nTest set As we hold the validation data back from the training process, we can hold back a test set data even from ourselves. It cannot be used to improve the model, it can only be used to evaluate the model at the very end. (Take out some data for testing and split the rest to 80% for training and 20% for validation)\n\n What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set? \nIt will automatically create a validation dataset if no validation set is provided. By default fastai takes out 20% that is held out is randomly.\n Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? \nA good validation or test set should be representative of new data you will see in the future. Sometimes this isn’t true if a random sample is used. For example, for times series data, selecting sets randomly does not make sense. Instead, defining different time periods for the train, validation, and test set is a better approach.\n What is overfitting? Provide an example. \nOverfitting is the single most important and challenging issue when training for all machine learning. Training a model in such a way that it remembers specific features of the input data, rather than generalizing well to data not seen during training.\n What is a metic? How does it differ from loss? \nThe concept of a metric may remind you of loss, but there is an important distinction. The entire purpose of loss is to define a “measure of performance” that the training system can use to update weights automatically. In other words, a good choice for loss is a choice that is easy for stochastic gradient descent to use. But a metric is defined for human consumption, so a good metric is one that is easy for you to understand, and that hews as closely as possible to what you want the model to do. At times, you might decide that the loss function is a suitable metric, but that is not necessarily the case.\n How can pretrained models help? \nA model that has weights that have already been trained on some other dataset is called a pretrained model. You should nearly always use a pretrained model, because it means that your model, before you’ve even shown it any of your data, is already very capable. For instance, parts of pretrained models will handle edge, gradient, and color detection, which are needed for many tasks. Using pretrained models is the most important method we have to allow us to train more accurate models, more quickly, with less data, and less time and money.\n What is the “head” of a model? \nThe head of a model is the part that is newly added to be specific to the new dataset. So the other layers which were not replaced where already trained for what the model war originally thought for.\n What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers? \nThe early layers learn simple features corners, edges, lines, circles. The later layers learn more advanced features like eyes, wheels, outlines of animals trees or humans.\n Are image models useful only for photos? \nNope! Image models can be useful for other types of images like sketches, medical data, etc.\nHowever, a lot of information can be represented as images . For example, a sound can be converted into a spectrogram, which is a visual interpretation of the audio. Time series (ex: financial data) can be converted to image by plotting on a graph. Even better, there are various transformations that generate images from time series, and have achieved good results for time series classification. There are many other examples, and by being creative, it may be possible to formulate your problem as an image classification problem, and use pretrained image models to obtain state-of-the-art results!\n What is an architecture? \nThe architecture is the template or structure of the model we are trying to fit. It defines the mathematical model we are trying to fit.\n What is segmantaion? \nCreating a model that can recognize the content of every individual pixel in an image is called segmentation. The result is a segmentation (mask) for which parts of the image correspond to the given label.\n What is y_range used for? When do we need is? \ny_range is being used to limit the values predicted when our problem is focused on predicting a numeric value in a given range (ex: predicting movie ratings, range of 0.5-5).\n What are “hyperparameters”? \nTraining models requires various other parameters that define how the model is trained. For example, we need to define how long we train for, or what the learning rate is used (how fast the model parameters are changed). These sorts of parameters are hyperparameters.\n What’s the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization? \n\nMake sure a training, validation, adn testing set is defined properly in order to evaluate the model in an appropriate manner.\nTry out a simple baseline, which future models should hopefully beat. Or even this simple baseline may be enough in some cases."

Examples of common data augmentation techniques for images are rotation, flipping, perspective warping, brightness changes and contrast changes. Data augmentation is useful for the model to better understand the basic concept of what an object is and how the objects of interest are represented in images. Therefore, data augmentation allows machine learning models to generalize better. This is especially important when it can be slow and expensive to label data."

The columns represent the images that the model predicted as black, grizzly and teddy bears, respectively. Therefore, the diagonal of the matrix shows the images that were classified correctly, and the off-diagonal cells represent those that were classified incorrectly.\nA confusion matrix is helpful to see where exactly our errors occurring 1. You can see if there are datasets errors (images with no bears or entries labeled incorrectly) 2. Or you can see if there is problem with the model (images with unusual lighting or blurred images)\nThe intuitive approach to doing data cleaning is to do it before you train a model. But you can also train a quick and simple model first, and then use it to help us with data cleaning. fastai includes a handy GUI for data cleaning called ImageClassifierCleaner that allows you to choose a category and the training versus validation set and view the highest-loss images (in order), along with menus to allow images to be selected for removal or relabeling:\ncleaner = ImageClassifierCleaner(learn)\ncleaner"

    "text": "Avoid Disasters\nYou should always have in mind that it’s difficult to understand the behavior of a deep learning model. In a neural network the behavior emerges from the models attempt to match the training data, rather than being exactly defined.\nOne general problem is the out-of-domain data problem. That is to say, there may be data that our model sees in production that is very different from what it saw during training. There isn’t a complete technical solution to this problem, instead, we have to be careful about rolling out a deep learning model.\nAnother problem ist a domain is a domain shift, whereby the type of data that our model sees changes over time. For instance, an insurance company may use a deep learning model arr part of its pricing and risk algorithm, but over time the types of customers the company attracts and the types of risks it represents may change so much that the original training data is no longer relevant.\nHigh-Level approach to mitigate the risks on a roll-out\n\n\n\nMitigate risk on rollout"
